### Micro-youtube
This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of youtube video player page.
The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.
